# DFTooling Resource Pack Repository
The DFTooling resource pack repositories stores resourcepacks that plots use on the DiamondFire server.

## Add a pack
Use the [FireClient](https://modrinth.com/mod/fireclient) ([Source](https://github.com/AlignedCookie88/FireClient)) mod to upload packs.

1. Make sure the pack is located in your Minecraft instance's `resourcepacks` folder.
2. Run `/uploadpack <filename>` to upload the pack. It automatically zips folders before upload. You must quote your filename if it contains a space.
